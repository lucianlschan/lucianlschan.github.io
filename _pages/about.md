I am a final year DPhil student in Statistics at the University of Oxford. I am a member of the [Oxford Protein Informatics Group](http://opig.stats.ox.ac.uk/), supervised by Professor Garrett M. Morris.

My research interests lie in the machine learning, computational statistics and topological data analysis. In particular, I am interested in applying these techniques to solve problems in chemistry and biology.
