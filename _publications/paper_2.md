excerpt: 'We apply Bayesian optimization with prior knowledge of correlated torsion to find the lowest energy conformer. Bivariate von-Mises mixture models are used to capture the correlated torsion and constrain the search space. We showed that it outperformed the genetic algorithm and the standard Bayesian optimization.'
